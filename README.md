# Eleni Michala – Portfolio

MSc Applied Artificial Intelligence @ University of Warwick | 
BSc Computer Science @ University of Cyprus

I’m a Computer Science graduate currently pursuing my MSc in Applied AI.
My work spans machine learning, backend development, and full-stack web applications.
I enjoy building practical systems, optimizing performance, and explaining technical concepts clearly.

### Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, SQL
- Frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Django, Wagtail CMS
- Tools & Platforms: Docker, Kafka, MSSQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Git, Linux (command line)
- Specialties: Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Full-Stack Web Development, Microservices, Distributed Systems

# Featured Projects

### - Kohonen Self-Organising Map (Python)
A full Python implementation of a Kohonen SOM for clustering handwritten English characters.
Includes custom training/testing pipelines, error visualisation, and tunable parameters (grid size, learning rate, epochs).
- Repo: https://github.com/Elenimichala55/kohonen-som

### - LMS – Leave Management System (Spring Boot)
A Spring Boot–based system where employees request leave and managers approve/update/delete requests.
Includes role-based authentication (user, manager), REST endpoints, and a clean multi-layer architecture.
- Repo: https://github.com/Elenimichala55/lms

### - Weather Dashboard (JavaScript)
A responsive dashboard built using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
Displays 5-day forecasts, temperature/humidity/pressure charts, and UI animations using the OpenWeather API.
- Repo: https://github.com/Elenimichala55/weather-dashboard

### - Payments Microservice (FastAPI + Kafka + Docker + PostgreSQL)
A distributed microservice implementing asynchronous payment processing.
Uses FastAPI, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Docker Compose for event-driven architecture and inter-service communication.
Includes producer/consumer logic and database persistence.
